# For MacOS 

## Prerequisites
- Swift Insalled
- MacOS System

### Step 1: Prepare Your System

Ensure you have Swift installed on your macOS system. You can install Swift via Xcode or directly from the Swift.org website.

### Step 2: Create a Swift Script File

Open a text editor (such as TextEdit or Xcode) and copy the provided Swift script into a new file.

### Step 3: Save the Script File

Save the file with a `.swift` extension, for example, `installation_script.swift`.

### Step 4: Set Execute Permission (Optional)

If you want to execute the script directly from the Terminal without specifying the Swift interpreter, you'll need to give it execute permission. Open Terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script file. Then run the following command:

```bash
chmod +x installation_script.swift
```

### Step 5: Run the Script

#### Option 1: Run from Terminal

Open Terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script file. Then run the following command:

```bash
swift installation_script.swift
```

#### Option 2: Run by Double-clicking

Alternatively, you can run the script by double-clicking on the script file in Finder. This will automatically open Terminal and execute the script.

### Step 6: Follow Script Instructions

Follow the instructions provided by the script in Terminal. The script will present you with a menu of options for installation.

### Step 7: Proceed with Installation

Choose the appropriate options according to your requirements, such as selecting Bare Linux or Docker Container options.

### Step 8: Complete Installation

Once you've selected the desired options, the script will proceed with the installation process.

### Step 9: Verify Installation

After the script completes execution, verify that the installation was successful by checking the installed components or running the application as instructed.

### Step 10: Exit the Script

Once you've completed the installation and verified everything is working as expected, you can exit the script by following the on-screen instructions or closing the Terminal window.

That's it! You've successfully installed and run the Swift installation script on your macOS system.
